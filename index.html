            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-2">Cheese Muffins</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">These Cheese Muffins are absolutely terrific as is, and it’s how I make them most of the time.

                Having said that though, it’s a sensational base for all sorts of add ins. Imagine the possibilities! I’ve used sun dried tomatoes, olives and feta in the photo below. Try mushrooms, spinach, zucchini (grated and excess liquid squeezed out), BACON, ham, chorizo, even cooked chicken. You could really turn these savoury muffins into a mini meal!
                
                I’ve added some more suggestions in the recipe notes – basically, just add 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of whatever add ins you want.</p>

                AMY'S GRANOLA RECIPE
                
                
                It's all about breakfast in our house. Lee's favorite meal of the day is breakfast and before we even met I used to flirt with him, recounting detailed menus of breakfasts I had made. Now he gets the goods everyday, just about.
                
                Today we had lemon brown sugar blueberry pancakes. I've been on the hunt for the perfect blueberry pancake recipe and this one might be it. Excellent flavor, sweet but tangy and full of berries. It's really the texture that's so hard to manage. The batter has to be thick enough to hold the blueberries but thin enough to still make tender pancakes and not come out too cakey.
                
                I also made a batch of granola this morning for breakfasts to come. The recipe is my own, but is loosely based on Jane Brody's Great Granola from her Good Food Book.
                
                Note: This recipe can be endlessly adapted. You can add flax seed to the sesame seeds or mix in 1/3 cup wheat germ with the nuts at the end of baking.
                
                Amy's Granola
                
                Ingredients
                
                1/4 cup butter or margarine
                1/4 cup honey
                1 tablespoon sesame seeds
                3 cups oats
                1/3 cup sunflower seeds
                1/3 - 1/2 cup nuts, chopped
                (any combination of almonds, walnuts, pecans, etc)
                
                Optional:
                1 teaspoon cinnamon
                1/4 cup dried fruit
                (cranberries, raisins, chopped apricots, etc.)
                
                Instructions
                
                Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Melt butter and honey together. Reserve 1-2 tablespoons of wet ingredients. Mix the melted butter and honey with the oats and sunflower seeds. Put oats and sunflower seed mixture on a parchment lined rimmed baking pan. Bake for 12 minutes stirring often. Add the sesame seeds to the reserved butter/honey mixture then add the chopped nuts and sesame seed mixture to the oats and bake for 2-5 minutes, watch carefully! When golden brown, let cool and store in an airtight container.
                
                Optional:
                Add cinnamon and dried fruit after granola cools
                
                Enjoy!</p>

            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-2">BEAN AND LEGUME PASTA</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Much as I love pasta, I’m not sure it loves me. Last year my carb-heavy comfort food diet led to some weight gain so I looked into low carb pasta as an alternative. There’s a lot out there and I’m still trying different brands and styles, but I thought now would be a good time to share what I’ve learned so far. Pasta with Butternut Squash and Brussels Sprouts My introduction to legume and bean-based pasta was thanks to Barilla. I was lucky because I got to attend a webinar with Barilla’s incredible chef, Lorenzo Boni . I tried his recipe for  pasta with butternut squash and Brussels sprouts   which I definitely recommend and have now made several times. If you’ve seen his wildly popular (150k+ followers!) Instagram feed you know he’s a master at making all kinds of pasta dishes and that he often eats plant-based meals. I followed up with him to get some tips on cooking with pasta made from beans and legumes. Pasta made with beans and legumes is higher in protein and so the recommended</p>

                BLUEBERRY MUFFINS:RECIPE
                
                My latest warehouse find was an enormous package of blueberries imported from Canada. Looking at the package I saw the word "bleuets". Apparently in French speaking Canada blueberries are called bleuets. Isn't that a sweet word? Much more charming than "myrtille", which is what I learned in French class. Though truthfully I like the word blueberry too. It's so very accurate. But bleuets kind of hints at how cute they are.
                
                Frozen blueberries are fine, but fresh ones are really special. They are such sweet little gems to bake with. When I wrote about blueberries last Summer, I suggested adding blueberries to pancakes and muffins. But I didn't have any specific recipes for you. Well I do now! My blueberry muffin recipe is adapted from the one in The King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion The All-Purpose Baking Cookbook. While I highly recommend the cookbook, the King Arthur Flour website has TONS of recipes too. Those King Arthur people know what they're doing when it comes to baking.
                
                My ideal muffin is not too greasy, too sweet, or too big. It's light with a tender crumb, and a little tang to it. After having tried many different times to bake perfect muffins, my favorite recipe is one that happened by accident. I wanted to make blueberry muffins but realized I didn't have enough blueberries. So I added some dried cherries and they turned out great. I tried the recipe again with dried cranberries and that worked well too.
                
                I like making smaller batches of muffins. My recipe is for just 6 muffins which is just the right amount if you ask me. You could easily double the recipe if you want to. It's not a super healthy recipe, but go ahead and indulge after all, blueberries are full of antioxidants, fiber and vitamin C. That's gotta count for something.
                
                Blueberry Muffins
                makes 6 muffins
                
                Ingredients
                
                1/4 cup butter
                1/2 cup sugar
                1 egg
                1 cup flour
                1 teaspoon baking powder
                1/4 teaspoon salt
                1/4 cup milk
                1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon peel
                3/4 cup blueberries, either fresh or frozen
                1/2 cup dried cherries or cranberries
                1 teaspoon sugar (preferably turbinado or raw sugar)
                
                Instructions
                
                Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a muffin pan with paper liners. Cream the butter and sugar in a food processor or mixer. When thoroughly combined, add the egg and blend. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and lemon peel, blend and then gradually add the milk. Put batter in a mixing bowl and gently fold in the blueberries and dried fruit. Fill muffin tins completely and top each muffin with a sprinkle of sugar. Bake for 20-30 minutes or until a bamboo skewer comes out clean. Let cool for 5 minutes then move to a rack.
